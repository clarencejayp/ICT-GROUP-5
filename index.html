<p class="title"> The Youth That We Are Today </p>

<p class="lines">
<br> The youth that we are today
<br> All fearless, full of hope
<br> Some may be held back by the past,
<br> And get terrified of the future,
Yet remains trying, firm, and finding their meanings. </br>

<br> We, a product of all the time's misery, are ready to flee;
<br> Eager to seep out the should-be-forgotten memories,
<br> Keen to face the fate that lies ahead of us.
<br> With our minds all thinking alike,
<br> Changes that the world needs will arise. </br>

<br> Dreams will be the power that we'll use,
<br> Our voices and talents are the weapons, 
<br> The shields are the knowledge and experience we get along the way. 
<br> And now we're ready to get bruised,
<br> Because that is how it is to be
<br> The youth that we are today. </br> </p>
